# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset** to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on clinical data.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **File Used:** `heart.csv`
- **Target Column:** `condition` (1 = Heart Disease, 0 = No Heart Disease)

## 🎯 Objective
To build and evaluate binary classification models (Logistic Regression & Decision Tree) to identify patients at risk of heart disease.

## 🧠 Skills Applied
- Binary classification
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC
- Feature importance analysis

## 🔍 Steps Followed
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values (if any)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature scaling
5. Model training:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Tree
6. Model evaluation:
    - Accuracy
    - Confusion Matrix
    - ROC Curve
7. Feature importance visualization

## 📊 Model Results (Logistic Regression)
- **Accuracy:** _Your Score_
- **AUC:** _Your AUC_
